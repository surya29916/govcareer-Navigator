Project Idea (Ideation)

Students and fresh graduates often struggle to find clear career guidance, especially when searching for government and private job opportunities based on their engineering branch. Existing platforms are either too crowded, outdated, or not personalized.
GovCareer Navigator solves this by providing a clean, structured, and personalized job-exploration system where users can easily select their branch, job category (government/private), and instantly see relevant opportunities with details like eligibility, skills, preparation guidance, syllabus, and interview questions.
